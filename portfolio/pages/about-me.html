			<p>Hello there,</p>

			<p>My name is Alvaro, I am a metal head, Joker and Manchester United fan. I feel fortunate because I do what I love for a living, creating and learning.</p>

			<p>The reason I found so much joy in design and web development is that every project is different and that I’m surrounded by sources of inspiration.</p>

			<p>Time ago in LA there was a Frank Gehry exhibition, there were videos of some of his creations and sketches, but one of them was a documentary and he said a couple of things that I could relate to. <blockquote>Is starting hard? You know it is. I’m always scared that I’m not gonna know what to do, it’s a terrifying moment. And then when I start, I’m always amazed, so… that wasn’t so bad.</blockquote></p>

			<p>Those are the same feelings and thoughts that go through my head when I have to create something, anxiety and nervousness, but then I just start making lines and patterns, research about the subject, concepts and ideas start to come together.</p>

			<p>This is my passion and I can’t see myself doing anything else for a living. I hope we can work together and create something remarkable.</p>
